## GCD | 1/2 Day
Accelerate your coding with the power of AI. This half-day course introduces developers to GitHub Copilot, an AI-powered coding assistant that helps write code faster and with fewer errors. Through live demonstrations and hands-on exercises, attendees will learn how to effectively use Copilot in their everyday workflowsâ€”from generating boilerplate code to exploring unfamiliar frameworks and improving productivity.

### Audience
This course is designed for software developers of all experience levels who want to improve their development speed and efficiency using AI tools. It is particularly valuable for teams exploring generative AI coding assistants or looking to standardize the use of Copilot across projects. Familiarity with GitHub and basic programming knowledge (in languages such as JavaScript, Python, C#, or SQL) is assumed.
