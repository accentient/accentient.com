## AQATP | 1 Day
Azure DevOps Services provide a set of cloud-hosted tools that software teams can use as an end-to-end solution to plan, develop, test, and deliver value in the form of working software. Azure Test Plans enable a team to plan, track, and assess quality throughout the entire development effort. This one day course will demonstrate how an agile team can configure and use Azure Test Plans to effectively assure quality in web and desktop applications. To maximize learning, students will work in teams, in a common team project, on a common case study.

### Audience
This course is appropriate for all members of a software development team, especially those who are actively involved in defining, assuring, and increasing the overall quality of their software products. This course will also provide value for individuals outside the development team (managers, Scrum Masters, coaches, and other stakeholders) who want hands-on exposure to the capabilities of Azure Test Plans.

### Modules
1. Test Case Management
2. Test Planning
3. Running Tests
