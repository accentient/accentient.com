## Why Scrum

The process wars are over. Agile won. By agile, we mean Scrum, because agile is not something that can be done. Agility is a mindset that is achieved. For software development teams and organizations, agility is achieved through Scrum. Scrum is a lightweight, empirical framework used for developing and sustaining complex products, such as software. This is why we have partnered with Scrum.org.

- Higher Product Quality: Continuous testing and adaptation result in better quality products.
- Transparency: Scrum provides visibility into project progress for informed decision-making.
- Customer Satisfaction: Incremental deliveries and flexibility lead to happier customers.
- Collaboration: Teams work closely, fostering open communication and shared ownership.
- Faster Time-to-Market: Time-boxed iterations lead to quicker releases and a competitive edge.
- Continuous Improvement: Regular retrospectives promote ongoing process enhancement.

## Professional Scrum Developer

In cooperation with Microsoft and Scrum.org, Accentient has created the Applying Professional Scrum for Software Development (APS-SD) program. Formerly known as the Professional Scrum Developer (PSD) program, APS-SD is built around the core accountability of the Developer - those individuals accountable for delivering working, high-quality increments of software at the end of every Sprint.

This course is designed for software developers working in Scrum environments who want to deepen their understanding of Agile engineering practices, Scrum mechanics, and cross-functional collaboration. Students attending an APS-SD course will learn how to build potentially shippable increments of product using modern development tools and practices, such as test-driven development (TDD), continuous integration, automated testing, pair programming, and version control with Git—all in the context of a real Scrum Team.

The APS-SD course provides immersive, hands-on experience. Participants work as members of a self-organizing Scrum Team, iteratively and incrementally delivering functionality from a Product Backlog and learning how to apply Scrum rules and principles effectively. Emphasis is placed on achieving a Definition of Done, ensuring that every increment is truly releasable and production-ready.

Originally developed in collaboration with Microsoft's Visual Studio team, the PSD program was the first Scrum course to blend Agile development practices with modern tooling. Over time, the curriculum has evolved into APS-SD, embracing a wider range of platforms, languages, and toolchains, making it applicable for teams using .NET, Java, Node.js, Python, or any other modern stack.

Whether you're new to Scrum or looking to sharpen your development skills within an Agile context, APS-SD offers both the practical skills and Scrum foundation necessary to succeed in today’s fast-paced, team-driven software environments.


## Non Scrum.org Training

While Accentient is proud to deliver official Scrum.org-certified training, we also recognize that not every team or organization requires a formal certification path. For those looking to build Scrum knowledge, improve collaboration, or adopt Agile practices more pragmatically, we've developed a suite of non-certified courses. These workshops are custom-designed by our experienced trainers and tailored for a variety of roles and organizational needs — from executives to stakeholders, developers, and product owners. They are ideal for teams that want to accelerate their Agile journey without the structure or cost of certification.

- [Managing Projects Using Scrum (1 day)](/mps/)
- **Scrum for Executives** (1 or ½ day)  
- **Scrum for Product Owners** (1 day)  
- **Scrum for Stakeholders** (1 day)  
- **Delivering Products with Azure DevOps and Scrum** (3 days)

These courses can be delivered on-site or remotely and customized to align with your team’s tools, structure, and delivery goals.
