## CICD | 1 Day
This one-day course demonstrates how an agile team can configure and use Azure Pipelines to effectively build, test, and deploy software while practicing Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD). To maximize learning, students will work in teams, in a common Azure DevOps project, on a common case study.

### Audience
This course is appropriate for all members of a software development team, especially those who are actively involved in automating the building, testing, and deploying of software. This course will also provide value for individuals outside the development team (managers, IT, operations, and other stakeholders) who want hands-on exposure to the capabilities of Azure Pipelines. Ideally, attendees should have some experience with Azure DevOps. Understanding of C# and .NET 6.0 will be beneficial but is not required.

### Modules
1. Continuous Integration
2. Continuous Delivery
3. Continuous Deployment

### Prerequisites
Some Azure Devops and team-based development experience recommended.
