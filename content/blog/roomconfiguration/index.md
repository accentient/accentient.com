When planning a team-based training event, please consider the room configuration. Having a comfortable table and chair arrangement will go a long ways towards a positive learning experience.

Round or square tables allowing students to sit in teams of 4-6 with laptops is ideal. Include wall space for plenty of whiteboards, flip charts, and sticky notes. Even for training that is not specifically team-based, pairing is still encouraged. This means there only needs to be one laptop for every two students.

Less than ideal are large U-shaped tables, fixed rows, or large conference tables. It's harder for students to work as a team in these configurations.<img style="display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto; margin-bottom: 1rem; border: 1px solid black; box-shadow: 2px 2px 10px rgba(0,0,0,0.5);" src="NotGoodSetup.jpg" width="840" height="449"  alt="Not Good Setup" />

So, if possible, configure the classroom as an open space, with movable tables that can accommodate 4-6 students per table - either square or round tables. Long rectangular tables can typically be put side by side to make a square. Configuration in rows is <em>not</em> recommended, but sometimes cannot be avoided. Keep in mind that a less-than-ideal configuration will diminish the team-based learning experience.
