At the beginning of a <em>Sprint</em>, the <em>Product Owner</em> presents a refined and ordered <em>Product Backlog</em> to the <em>Developers</em>. A <em>Sprint Goa</em>l is crafted and the Developers select an achievable set of the items to achieve the Sprint Goal best. This is their forecast. The Developers also create a plan to achieve the Sprint Goal by developing the forecasted items. All of this goes into the <em>Sprint Backlog</em>.

The Developers proceed to work to achieve the Sprint Goal, assessing their progress and updating their plan at least daily in a short meeting known as the <em>Daily Scrum</em>. The <em>Scrum Master</em> helps the entire Scrum Team follow the rules of Scrum and be productive throughout the Sprint, as well as help the organization understand this empirical way of working.

At the end of the Sprint, the Developers have built a usable and releasable Done Increment of functionality that achieves the Sprint Goal. The Increment is inspected by stakeholders (users, customers, sponsors, managers, etc.) in the <em>Sprint Review</em>. Feedback is added to the Product Backlog, refined by the Scrum Team, and ordered by the Product Owner.

In the <em>Sprint Retrospective</em>, the Scrum Team then inspects their process, practices, and performance to make improvements to the way they work.

The above is repeated until a point when there is no value in continuing the development of the product.
