As a traveling Scrum and DevOps consultant I’m constantly asked “Should our team use Scrum”? Now you might think that being a Professional Scrum Trainer – and serious Scrum fanboy – I would always answer “Yes!”. Well, you would be wrong. I frequently talk people <em>out</em> of Scrum – for the right reasons.

Professional Scrum Trainers know how hard it is for a team, not to mention an organization, to adopt and practice Scrum according to the Scrum Guide. Therefore, we want to make sure the teams and nature of the work are right for the Scrum. To that end, I’ve come up with five simple, mostly non-scientific, yes/no questions that I use to survey the inquisitor.
<h3><strong>My Five Questions</strong></h3>
<ol>
 	<li>Do you have at least three technical people to do the work?</li>
 	<li>Are you developing a product/service in increments? (vs. just doing one-off/unrelated work)</li>
 	<li>Is the majority of the work large enough to require a team? (vs. smaller, individual task-sized work)</li>
 	<li>Is the majority of the work complex? (per the <a href="https://www.scrum.org/resources/scrum-right-tool-you-part-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stacey model</a>)</li>
 	<li>Is the majority of the work planable? (vs. unplanned/support type of work)</li>
</ol>
If the person answers “yes” to all 5 questions, then I’ll recommend they move forward with Scrum. If there are 3 or 4 “yes” answers, the Scrum framework will <em>probably</em> help the team be more successful, but they may experience some friction. If there are only 1 or 2 “yes” answers, the Scrum framework will be more overhead than helpful. Again, my non-scientific opinion here.
<h3><strong>It’s Not About Effort</strong></h3>
None of my questions include any culture, behavior, or type-of-industry questions. I don’t care about existing management structure, level of trust, technical debt, whether they have remote team members, or whether they are a government agency or financial institution. Those attributes relate more to the level of <em>effort </em>required for Scrum adoption to become successful. The five questions are more about the nature of the work and less about the current level of dysfunction the team or organization is experiencing (or causing).

Putting my consultant hat back on, the five questions tell me whether I should <em>proceed</em> with a Scrum training/coaching engagement or “fire the customer” before I get started. Follow-up questions about the culture, current behavior, and environment will tell me how much <em>effort</em> will be required. Incidentally, those are not simple yes/no questions, but an understanding that evolves over multiple in-person conversations and assessments.
<h3><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3>
My five questions are not weighted equally. For example, if someone answers “yes” to four questions, but answers “no” to having at least three technical people, then it may be a non-starter. Since opinions will vary on the weighting of these questions, I recommend using them purely as a guideline for your own questions or assessment.
