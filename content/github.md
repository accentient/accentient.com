<br/><br/>
GitHub is the world's most popular platform for software development, enabling millions of developers to collaborate on code, manage projects, and build software together. As of 2024, GitHub has over 100 million users worldwide. Microsoft acquired GitHub in 2018  and it's been innovating ever since—introducing tools like GitHub Copilot, Codespaces, and advanced CI/CD features to empower developers even more.

### GitHub Copilot
GitHub Copilot is an AI-powered coding assistant developed by GitHub and OpenAI. It suggests entire lines or blocks of code in real time, helping developers write code faster, reduce repetitive tasks, and stay in flow. Copilot supports dozens of languages and integrates directly into popular editors like Visual Studio Code.

### GitHub Actions
GitHub Actions is a powerful CI/CD and automation tool that enables developers to define custom workflows directly in their repositories. From building and testing code to deploying applications, Actions helps automate every step of the development lifecycle. With reusable workflows and a vast marketplace of pre-built actions, teams can move faster and ship with confidence.

### GitHub Projects
GitHub Projects is a planning and project management tool built into GitHub. It allows teams to organize work using customizable views like boards and tables, automate tasks, and link issues and pull requests for seamless tracking. Designed for developers, it brings project planning closer to the code.

### Integration with Azure DevOps
GitHub and Azure DevOps work better together. Connect your GitHub repo to Azure Boards to track work with linked commits and pull requests. Use Azure Pipelines for builds and deployments, all triggered from GitHub. Keep code, tasks, and releases in sync—without leaving your tools.
