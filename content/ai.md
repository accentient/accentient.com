AI is now so advanced that it can support software teams across nearly every stage of development. It helps with product discovery by analyzing user feedback and trends, speeds up coding with smart suggestions, and improves testing through automation and better coverage. Even in delivery, AI can improve CI/CD and catch potential issues early—making the whole process faster and more efficient.

### AI for Software Teams
Our first of many planned AI courses, this one focuses on the software development team—Product Owners, Scrum Masters, and Developers—equipping each role with practical, hands-on skills to apply generative AI tools in their daily work.
