AI is now so advanced that it can support software teams across nearly every stage of development. It helps with product discovery by analyzing user feedback and trends, speeds up coding with smart suggestions, and improves testing through automation and better coverage. Even in delivery, AI can improve CI/CD and catch potential issues early—making the whole process faster and more efficient.

### AI for Software Teams
Our first of many planned AI courses, this one focuses on the software development team—Product Owners, Scrum Masters, and Developers—equipping each role with practical, hands-on skills to apply generative AI tools in their daily work.

### GitHub Copilot
GitHub Copilot is an AI-powered coding assistant developed by GitHub and OpenAI. It suggests entire lines or blocks of code in real time, helping developers write code faster, reduce repetitive tasks, and stay in flow. Copilot supports dozens of languages and integrates directly into popular editors like Visual Studio Code.
