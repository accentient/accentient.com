## MPAB | 1 Day
This course is appropriate for all members of a software development team, especially those who are actively involved with creating and refining a product backlog as well as planning and executing work within a sprint. This course will also provide value for individuals outside the development team (managers, Scrum Masters, coaches, and other stakeholders) who want hands-on exposure to the capabilities of Azure Boards. Having some project management and software development experience, either as a team member or as a manager, is recommended. Experience with Agile software development, Scrum, and Visual Studio are also helpful, but not required. Attendees should read and be familiar with the [Scrum Guide](https://scrumguides.org) prior to class.
### Audience
This course is designed for developers, DevOps engineers, QA professionals, and technical team members who want to automate their workflows using GitHub Actions.
