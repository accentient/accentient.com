## BSA | 1 Day
This hands-on course is your one-day test drive into **modern software development with AI in the loop**. Working inside a real open-source codebase, attendees will pair with tools like GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT to design, develop, and ship working features — all in a live, collaborative lab environment. No hype. No futurecasting. Just real-world experience with today’s AI tooling.

As part of the course, you’ll contribute to real improvements on [truenarrative.io](https://www.truenarrative.io), applying AI tools to make meaningful updates to content, design, and functionality on a live site.

### Audience
This course is designed for software developers, tech leads, and agile delivery teams who want to level up their AI fluency and integrate tools like Copilot, ChatGPT, and natural language workflows into real development. Whether you’re AI-curious or already dabbling, this lab will sharpen your skills and mindset.

### Modules
1. AI Developer Stances – When and how to lean on AI  
2. Pairing with Copilot – Navigating intent, prompt shaping, and refactoring  
3. ChatOps with ChatGPT – Using LLMs for design, testing, and documentation  
4. Real Feature Delivery – Guided tasks inside a shared codebase  
5. Going to Production – Quality checks, collaboration, and committing with confidence
