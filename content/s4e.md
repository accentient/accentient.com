## S4E | 1 Day or 1/2 Day
This instructor-led class is intended to answer three questions commonly asked by executives, managers, and other decision makers: *What is Scrum?* *Why should I care?* and *What will be expected of me to properly adopt Scrum?* Through presentation and discussion, attendees will learn the answers to these questions. By forming into teams and collaborating on activities, attendees will further experience these truths.

### Audience
This course is intended for executives, managers, and other leaders who want to learn more about Scrum, why it works, and a high-level approach to get started on their path to agility.
