Microsoft Azure DevOps offers a comprehensive suite of tools and services that empower software teams to plan, develop, test, and deliver high-quality software quickly and efficiently. Each service is open, flexible, and designed to integrate seamlessly with any application, framework, platform, or cloud. Teams can adopt Azure DevOps as a complete end-to-end solution or use individual services alongside their existing toolchain.

### Azure Boards
Azure Boards offers agile tools to plan, track, and manage work from idea to release. With support for backlogs, boards, sprints, and dashboards, it helps teams stay organized and aligned — whether using Scrum, Kanban, or a custom process.

### Azure Test Plans
Azure Test Plans helps teams manage and improve software quality through manual, automated, and exploratory testing. With tools for test case management, defect tracking, and reporting, it supports quality at every stage. Integrated with Azure DevOps, it connects tests to code changes and requirements for a seamless, end-to-end QA process.

### Integrating with GitHub
Azure DevOps and GitHub connect seamlessly. Use GitHub for code and pull requests, and track progress in Azure Boards. Trigger builds and deployments in Azure Pipelines straight from GitHub commits. Get full visibility from code to release—all inside Azure DevOps.
