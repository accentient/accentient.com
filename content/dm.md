## DMP | 1 Day
<a href="https://www.dysfunctionmapping.com/" target="_blank">Dysfunction Mapping</a> is a hands-on workshop designed to help teams identify and solve the real problems that hold them back. Rather than reacting to symptoms or fighting fires, participants will learn a repeatable framework for surfacing dysfunctions, understanding their purpose, and crafting testable hypotheses to improve team performance and organizational health.

### Audience
This course is ideal for Scrum Masters, Agile Coaches, delivery leads, team managers, and other professionals who want to move beyond surface-level improvements and develop measurable, systemic solutions to team and organizational challenges.

### Modules
1. Observing and Capturing Symptoms  
2. Theming and Mapping Dysfunctions  
3. Surfacing Purpose  
4. Forming Hypotheses  
5. Taking Action and Inspecting Outcomes

### Prerequisites
A working knowledge of agile delivery practices (such as Scrum or Kanban) is recommended. The course is designed to scale to your experience level â€” the more insight and context you bring, the more you'll take away. No prior experience with Dysfunction Mapping is needed.
